Remember to create a `requirements.txt` file listing out the Python packages required for your repository. Users can then easily install them using pip.

Replace placeholders like `<repository_url>` and `directory_name` with appropriate details specific to your repository. Also, you can replace the EDA image URL placeholder with an actual image URL if you have one to make your README visually appealing.
